## User Flow

1. Patient navigates to "Doctors" tab in sidebar
2. Patient views list of available doctors
3. Patient can search for specific doctors by name, specialty, or hospital
4. Patient clicks "Book Appointment" button for desired doctor
5. Appointment booking form opens with doctor ID pre-filled
6. Patient fills in appointment date, time, name, and phone

## Implementation Notes

### Mock Data
Since there is no API endpoint to fetch a list of all doctors, the doctors page currently uses mock data. In a production environment, this would be replaced with a real API call.

### Customer Details
As per user preference, the appointment booking form now includes:
- Customer Name field
- Customer Phone field
These fields are sent to the backend API when booking an appointment.

### URL Parameters
The doctors page passes the selected doctor's ID as a URL parameter to the appointment booking page, which pre-fills the doctor ID field.

## Future Enhancements

1. Replace mock data with real API endpoint when available
2. Add doctor profile pages with more detailed information
3. Implement doctor availability calendar for more precise booking
4. Add doctor reviews and ratings system
5. Include doctor photos in the listing
