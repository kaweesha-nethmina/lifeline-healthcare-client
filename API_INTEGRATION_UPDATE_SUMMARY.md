# API Integration Update Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the updates made to integrate real API data into the existing pages that previously used mock data. All changes maintain the existing UI/UX design while replacing mock data with real data from the backend API.

## Updated Pages

### 1. Patient Dashboard (`/app/patient/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced mock appointment data with real data from `PatientService.getAppointmentHistory()`
- Replaced mock medical records data with real data from `PatientService.getMedicalRecords()`
- Added loading states and error handling
- Added data fetching logic using useEffect
- Maintained existing UI components and styling

**API Endpoints Integrated:**
- `GET /patients/appointments` - Fetch appointment history
- `GET /patients/medical-records` - Fetch medical records

### 2. Patient Appointments (`/app/patient/appointments/page.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced mock appointment data with real data from `PatientService.getAppointmentHistory()`
- Added loading states and error handling
- Implemented proper date/time formatting
- Added data fetching logic using useEffect
- Maintained existing tab functionality (upcoming/past)
- Preserved all UI components and interactions

**API Endpoints Integrated:**
- `GET /patients/appointments` - Fetch all appointments

### 3. Patient Medical Records (`/app/patient/medical-records/page.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced mock medical records data with real data from `PatientService.getMedicalRecords()`
- Added loading states and error handling
- Implemented search functionality with real-time filtering
- Added data fetching logic using useEffect
- Maintained existing tab structure (records/prescriptions)
- Preserved all UI components and styling

**API Endpoints Integrated:**
- `GET /patients/medical-records` - Fetch all medical records

### 4. Doctor Dashboard (`/app/doctor/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced mock appointment data with real data from `DoctorService.getAppointmentSchedule()`
- Added doctor profile fetching with `DoctorService.getProfile()`
- Added loading states and error handling
- Implemented proper time formatting
- Added data fetching logic using useEffect
- Maintained existing UI components and styling
- Added placeholder for recent patients (requires additional API endpoint)

**API Endpoints Integrated:**
- `GET /doctors/profile` - Fetch doctor profile
- `GET /doctors/appointments` - Fetch appointment schedule

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Data Fetching Pattern

All pages now use a consistent data fetching pattern:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      setLoading(true)
      setError(null)
      
      // Fetch data from API service
      const response = await Service.getData()
      
      if (response.data) {
        setData(response.data)
      }
    } catch (err) {
      setError("Error message")
    } finally {
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }

  fetchData()
}, [])
```

### 2. Loading States

Each page now includes:
- Initial loading spinner
- Loading text in headers
- Proper loading states for all data sections

### 3. Error Handling

Each page now includes:
- Error messages for failed API requests
- Retry functionality
- Graceful degradation when data is unavailable

### 4. Data Transformation

Data is properly transformed for display:
- Date formatting using `toLocaleDateString()`
- Time formatting using `toLocaleTimeString()`
- Status badge coloring based on status values
- Proper handling of missing or null data

### 5. Search Functionality

The medical records page includes:
- Real-time search filtering
- Case-insensitive matching
- Search across multiple fields (diagnosis, doctor name, treatment plan)

## Services Used

The following services were integrated:

1. **PatientService** (`@/lib/services/patient-service.ts`)
   - `getAppointmentHistory()` - Fetch patient appointments
   - `getMedicalRecords()` - Fetch patient medical records

2. **DoctorService** (`@/lib/services/doctor-service.ts`)
   - `getProfile()` - Fetch doctor profile
   - `getAppointmentSchedule()` - Fetch doctor appointments

## Authentication Integration

All pages now properly integrate with the existing authentication system:
- Data fetching only occurs when user is authenticated
- Proper error handling for authentication failures
- Use of `useAuth()` hook for user context

## Future Improvements

### 1. Additional API Endpoints Needed

Some features require additional API endpoints to be fully implemented:
- Doctor's "Recent Patients" section
- Prescription data in medical records
- Complete statistics data for doctor dashboard

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

Further improvements could include:
- More specific error messages based on HTTP status codes
- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Offline data caching

### 3. Performance Optimizations

Potential optimizations:
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Add data caching to reduce API calls
- Implement real-time updates with WebSockets

## Testing

All updated pages have been tested for:
- Successful data loading
- Loading states
- Error states
- Search functionality
- Tab switching
- Responsive design
- Authentication flow

## Files Modified

1. `app/patient/dashboard/page.tsx` - Patient dashboard with real data
2. `app/patient/appointments/page.tsx` - Patient appointments with real data
3. `app/patient/medical-records/page.tsx` - Medical records with real data
4. `app/doctor/dashboard/page.tsx` - Doctor dashboard with real data

## Services Utilized

The implementation leverages the previously created service layer:
- `@/lib/services/patient-service.ts`
- `@/lib/services/doctor-service.ts`
- `@/contexts/auth-context.tsx` for authentication

This update successfully replaces all mock data with real API integration while maintaining the existing user interface and experience.
