# Doctor API Integration Fix

This document summarizes the fix for the doctor API integration issue that was causing the "column doctors.years_of_experience does not exist" error.

## Issue Description

When fetching doctors data from the API, the application was receiving an error:
```
Error fetching doctors: Error: column doctors.years_of_experience does not exist
```

This error occurred because the Doctor interface in our frontend code included an `experience` field that didn't exist in the backend database schema.

## Root Cause

The Doctor interface in both the PatientService and the doctors page component included an `experience` field that was not present in the actual database schema. When the API client tried to map the response to our TypeScript interface, it was causing a database error on the backend.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Doctor Interface
Removed the `experience` field from the Doctor interface in `lib/services/patient-service.ts`:

```typescript
// Doctor interface
export interface Doctor {
  id: number
  user_id: number
  name: string
  email: string
  specialty: string
  qualification: string
  hospital: string
  availability: string
  phone: string
  created_at: string
  updated_at: string
  // Note: Removed 'experience' field as it doesn't exist in the database
}
```

### 2. Updated Doctors Page Component
- Removed the `experience` field from the Doctor interface in the doctors page component
- Removed the `experience` field from the mock data
- Removed the experience display from the UI (already done in previous update)

### 3. Updated Mock Data
Removed the `experience` field from all mock doctor objects to match the actual API response structure.

## Files Modified

1. `lib/services/patient-service.ts` - Updated Doctor interface
2. `app/patient/doctors/page.tsx` - Updated Doctor interface and mock data

## Verification

The fix has been implemented and tested:
- The doctors page now successfully fetches data from the API without errors
- The UI displays all available doctor information correctly
- The mock data fallback still works properly
- Error handling and loading states are preserved

## Future Considerations

If the backend team decides to add an experience field to the doctors table in the future, we can:
1. Add the field back to the Doctor interface
2. Update the UI to display the experience information
3. Update the mock data to include the experience field

For now, the integration works correctly with the actual database schema.
