# Doctor API Update Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks the changes to the Doctor API endpoint and related frontend implementations.

## API Endpoint
- **URL**: `GET /patients/doctors`
- **Description**: Retrieve all doctors in the system
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## Latest API Response Format
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "user_id": 3,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "12desimain@gmail.com",
    "specialty": "Cardiology",
    "qualification": "MD, Board Certified",
    "schedule": "Monday-Sunday: 9AM-5PM"
  }
]
```

## Fields Description
- `id`: Doctor's unique identifier
- `user_id`: Associated user ID
- `name`: Doctor's full name
- `email`: Doctor's email address
- `specialty`: Doctor's medical specialty (can be null)
- `qualification`: Doctor's qualifications (can be null)
- `schedule`: Doctor's working schedule (can be null)

## Implementation Notes
1. All fields except `id` and `user_id` can potentially be null
2. The frontend implementation handles null values gracefully
3. Search functionality includes name, specialty, and qualification fields
4. The Doctor interface in both the service layer and component has been updated to reflect this structure

# Doctor API Update

This document summarizes the update to match the actual API response format for the doctors endpoint.

## API Response Format

The actual API response for `GET /patients/doctors` is:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "user_id": 2,
    "specialty": "Cardiology",
    "qualification": "MD, Board Certified",
    "schedule": "Monday-Friday: 9AM-5PM"
  }
]
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Doctor Interface
Updated the Doctor interface in `lib/services/patient-service.ts` to match the actual API response:

```typescript
// Doctor interface
export interface Doctor {
  id: number
  user_id: number
  specialty: string
  qualification: string
  schedule: string
  // Note: This matches the actual API response format
}
```

### 2. Updated Doctors Page Component
- Updated the Doctor interface in the doctors page component
- Updated mock data to match the actual API response format
- Modified the UI to display information based on available fields:
  - Display "Doctor {user_id}" instead of doctor name
  - Show specialty and qualification
  - Display schedule information
- Updated search functionality to search by specialty and qualification

### 3. Files Modified
1. `lib/services/patient-service.ts` - Updated Doctor interface
2. `app/patient/doctors/page.tsx` - Updated UI to match API response

## Implementation Notes

### Limitations
The current API response does not include:
- Doctor names
- Contact information (phone, email)
- Hospital information
- Rating information

### Future Enhancements
To improve the doctors listing page, the backend API could be enhanced to include:
1. Doctor names by joining with the users table
2. Contact information
3. Hospital affiliations
4. Rating/review information
5. Profile pictures

For now, the implementation works with the available data and provides patients with the ability to:
- Browse available doctors
- See doctor specialties and qualifications
- View doctor schedules
- Book appointments with doctors

## Verification
The doctors page now successfully fetches data from the API without errors and displays the information appropriately based on the actual API response format.
